# HubSpokeLandingZone

## Welcome to the Azure Hub and Spoke Virtual Network project.

### This project will help you create a secure and scalable network architecture for your Azure workloads. You can use this project for both development and production environments. this solution supports both Azure Commercial as well as Azure Government.

### The project consists of the following components:

 - A hub virtual network that acts as a central point of connectivity to your on-premises network and hosts shared Azure services such as Azure Firewall, Azure Bastion, Azure Backup Vault, and Azure Log Analytics Workspace.
 
- Spoke virtual networks that isolate and manage your workloads separately in each spoke. You can later add multiple spokes in different subscriptions and environments.

- Virtual network peering or VPN connections that enable traffic flow between the hub and the spokes, and between the spokes and your on-premises network.

- Network security groups and route tables that define the network access policies and routing rules for your network resources.

- Classification tags for both billing as well as defined security zone.

### To use this project, you need to have an Azure subscription. You can connect this environment with an on-premises network with a VPN device or an ExpressRoute circuit. You also need to have some basic knowledge of Azure networking concepts and services.
